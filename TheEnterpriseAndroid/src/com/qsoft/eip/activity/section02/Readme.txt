Section 02 - Command Framework

Overview:
    In this section, you will experience a command pattern style development, which all actions within an
        activity or fragment will execute a single or a chain of commands, which writing in format that can
        reusable by others.
Guideline:
    SingleCommandActivity - This sample include only one simple command that bind to a button with default
        event is on click.
    MultiCommandsActivity - This sample include a button that execute multiple commands in order. No async
        command is used.
    ReusableCommandsActivity - This one reuse commands that we created in previous lessons, only to show the
        reusable ability of this framework.
